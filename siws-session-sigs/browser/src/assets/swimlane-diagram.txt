Title: Generating Session Signatures with Sign-in With Solana

User -> App: Clicks `Sign In` button
App -> User: Generates a Sign-in with Solana (SIWS) message
User -> App: User signs and submits signed SIWS message
App -> Lit Blockchain: Mints a PKP with Permitted Auth Methods
note App, Lit Network:
Two Auth Methods are permitted:

1. The Lit Action IPFS CID is permitted to sign anything using the minted PKP
2. A custom Auth Method derived from the User's Solana public key

The second Auth Method is not permitted to sign anything using the PKP. We're permitting it as an Auth Method to associate the User's Solana public key as authorized to sign using the PKP
App -> Lit Network: Submits a request to execute the SIWS Session Sigs Lit Action
Lit Network -> Lit Nodes: Requests each Lit Node to run the Lit Action
Lit Nodes -> Lit Nodes: Uses the raw SIWS message values to build the SIWS message according to the spec
Lit Nodes -> Lit Nodes: Validates the SIWS message values according to App specific logic
Lit Nodes -> Lit Nodes: Dervies a Solana public key using the built SIWS message and the User's signature
Lit Nodes -> Lit Blockchain: Submits a request to check if the derived Solana public key is a permitted Auth Method for the PKP
Lit Blockchain -> Lit Nodes: Returns `true` that the Solana public key is permitted to use the PKP
Lit Nodes -> Lit Network: Returns `true` to signal generation of Session Sigs using the PKP
Lit Network -> Lit Nodes: Collects signature shares to form the Session Signatures
Lit Network -> App: Returns Session Signatures
