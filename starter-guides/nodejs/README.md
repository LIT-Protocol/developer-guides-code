# Getting Started with a Lit SDK Node.js Implementation

This is a very simple example repository for getting started with a Node.js implementation of the Lit SDK. All it will do is connect an instance of the `LitNodeClient` to the Lit Network. If you are searching for more developed uses of Lit, the [Developer Guides Code](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/developer-guides-code) repository is for you. 

## Using This Repository

After downloading this repository, you will need to install the necessary dependencies and run the  `index.js` file using `node`.

```
yarn install
```
```
node index.js
```

Afterward, your terminal should inform you of connection to the Lit Network.
