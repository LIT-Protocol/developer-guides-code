# Solana + OpenAI Example within a Lit Action

This code example demonstrates how an OpenAI API key can be used to generate a response to be signed by a Lit Solana Wrapped Key, all within the confines of Lit's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).

## Prerequisites

- An Ethereum private key
  - This private key will be used to:
    - Own the PKP we mint. The minted PKP will be used to create new Wrapped Keys.
    - In order to pay for this, the corresponding Ethereum account must have Lit Test Tokens. If you do not have any, you can get some from [the faucet](https://chronicle-yellowstone-faucet.getlit.dev/)
- An OpenAI API key. We will use this to make a quest to OpenAI with our query to generate a response.
    - This example currently used the GPT-4o-mini model, please enable this model on your API key or change it if needed.
- This code example uses Node.js and Yarn. Please have these installed before running the example

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. `cd` into the code example directory: `cd solana-openai/nodejs`
3. Install the dependencies: `yarn`
4. Create and fill in the `.env` file: `cp .env.example .env`
   - `ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY`: **Required** This is the Ethereum private key that will be used to mint a PKP if one is not provided
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: **Required** This is the OpenAI API key that will be used to make a request within our Lit Action
   - `LIT_PKP_PUBLIC_KEY`: **Optional** You can also provide your own PKP for this example, but please make sure the PKP is owned by the provided Ethereum wallet
5. Test the example: `yarn test`

## Executing the Example

Executing the example can be done with running `yarn test`. This script will bundle our Lit Action with the necessary modules and run our [test file](./test/decryptApiKeyInActionTest.spec.ts).

Here's an overview of how the code example works:

1. Using an imported Ethereum private key, connect the wallet to the Lit RPC endpoint `Chronicle Yellowstone`
2. Connect to the Lit network using the `LitNodeClient` on the `datil-dev` network
3. Connect the `LitContracts` client to the Lit network (`datil-dev` in this case)
4. **If not provided in the .env file**: Mint a PKP
5. Create an AuthMethod using our Ethereum wallet
6. Use the created AuthMethod to be the authentication in generating Session Signatures for our PKP
7. Create a new Solana Wrapped Key
8. Fetch the encrypted metadata of our Wrapped Key
9. Define Access Control Conditions to encrypt our OpenAI API key with. This will ensure it is not revealed at any point. The ACCs are the same ones used to encrypt the Wrapped Key metadata.
10. Write a simple prompt for our AI to answer
11. Execute the Lit Action, providing our encrypted Solana Wrapped Key and OpenAI API key metadata, as well as our prompt.

### Lit Action Overview

Within the Lit Action:

1. Decrypt the Solana Wrapped Key and OpenAI API key
2. Remove the salt from the decrypted Solana private key
3. Query OpenAI for a response to the prompt
4. Create a Solana keypair from the decrypted private key
5. Use the Solana keypair to sign the OpenAI response
6. Verify the signature

### Expected Output

After running the test, the end of the output in the console should appear similar to:


```ts
âœ… Executed the Lit Action
{
  success: true,
  signedData: {},
  decryptedData: {},
  claimData: {},
  response: 'Signed message. Is signature valid: true',
  logs: 'OpenAI Response: Consider conducting thorough research and assessing market trends before making your decision on DogeCoin.\n' +
    'Solana Signature: Uint8Array(64) [\n' +
    '  169, 139,  64,  61,  97, 115, 213, 176, 232, 227, 185,\n' +
    '  208, 231, 224, 254, 129, 141, 144,  51, 240,   0,  85,\n' +
    '   60, 104, 205,  68,  58,  92, 171,  46, 147, 148,  56,\n' +
    '  219,  95, 164,  23, 248,  73,  40, 176, 185,  12, 142,\n' +
    '    5,  71, 131, 184,  90, 235,  30, 140,   4,  29, 233,\n' +
    '   63, 238, 142, 143,  14,  98,  51,  23,   8\n' +
    ']\n'
}
```
